# Grocery Tracking App
Smartphone web app made for tracking grocery store purchases

This was made as a product for a school project in less than a week. The app let's you scan the products you buy in grocery stores, so you can change your habits based on where you spend your money. Everything displayed to the user in the app is in Danish, the code itself is still in English.
